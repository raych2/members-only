# Members Only

This mobile responsive app allows users to view, post, or delete messages based on their user status. Non-users are able to see messages posted by anonymous users. Once a non-user signs up to gain user status, they will be able to post their own anonymous messages. Once the user becomes a member by entering a secret code, they will have access to view the full names/usernames of post authors. Members can also become admins by entering another secret code, in which they'll have access to delete messages. The project guidelines are listed in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/members-only) Node.js curriculum.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design an Express app that creates and authenticates users with PassportJS Local Strategy, as well as secure passwords with bcryptjs and allow certain permissions based on user type. I gained more practice using a NoSQL database (MongoDB), templating engine (Pug), and Express middleware (i.e. express-validator and connect-flash).
